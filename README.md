# DSA_SKILL_LAB  
This repository contains solutions to 7 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, collaboratively solved by a team of four. The problems are categorized based on their respective topics, with solutions provided in both C and Python for better understanding and comparison.

üìù Workflow  
‚úÖ Each team member contributed by solving a portion of the problems.  
‚úÖ Individual branches were created for each contributor and later merged into the main branch.  
‚úÖ All operations, including branching, merging, and pushing, were performed using the Git terminal.  
‚úÖ The repository was also forked to ensure version control and maintain smooth collaboration.
